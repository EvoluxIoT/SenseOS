# SenseOS Operating System
> **The universally connected and independent IoT operating system for embedded devices**
- SenseOS is a independent IoT operating system designed to ofter a secure, previsible and isolated environment for EvoluxIoT ecossystem embedded and connected devices

## Features
- **Portability without more wires attached!**
> From now on, you don't need a computer, smartphone, Raspberry PI or another device to program your microcontroller. Your development and production programming environment is ready to use anywhere and anytime even on memory and CPU constrained devices
- **Connected to the world with ease and security**
> Your OS is connected to a open-source ecosystem, providing ease of use for various tools such as data collection and manipulation from hardware and web api's, remote management and comunication with another SenseOS using SynapseLink Protocol, anti-theft tecnology protecting your data and team management for shared devices.
- **Modular Design for Device Drivers and Network Applications**
> Use your hardware easely with our abstracted drivers like you do a systemcall or develop your own (even if it's not compatible and prebuilt yet) and reach the productivity you desire. The same applies for applications (even with custom network protocols)
- **Powerful applications, features and tools like a portable computer for programmers**
> Includes API Action (a remote procedural call application ready to execute a script through a API call from the same/other device), the Neuron programming language with a custom IDE and debugger and another essential applications
- **Built for resource constrained environments and secure with session scopes and permission system**
> Never let any untrusted application access all systemcalls within your system! Every action must be authorized first before being successfuly executed protecting your data! 
> Also the system is build with a custom memory allocation and management feature for preventing system crash due to low memory and a process scheduler/manager to unleash the power of multiprocessing cenarios
